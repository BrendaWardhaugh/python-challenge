Module 3 - python challenge

Please see the attached documents in the PyBank and PyPoll folers. 

This challenge used import os and import csv to read csv files containing data.  For and if loops were then used to filter through the csv files to extract the desired results/outcomes. These results were then printed to the terminal and exported to a text file. 

## PyBank
Within the "Analysis" folder you will see the text document containing the results for the Financial Analysis:

Inside the "main.py" folder, you will find the code used to generate the results and in the "Resources folder" you will find the csv data used to populate these results.
